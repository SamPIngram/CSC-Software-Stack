# CSC-Software-Stack
Clinical Scientific Computing (CSC) Software Stack

## Warning
This code base is still in early development. The design of the stack is still in flux. Therefore it is only recommended for testing purposes and development currently. 

## Motivation
There are a substantial number of open source tools and applications that are widely being used in production and development. Many of these tools permissively used in closed source medical software solutions. This stack looks to standardise a range of these open-source tools and applications so that they can be more easily adopted by the Clinical Scientific Computing community. 

## Approach
At present the software stack includes several applications in a single repository. This may be split out in the future to multiple repositories. The inclusion of all applications in the single repository means that on each relase all docker images are rebuilt which includes updates to all major components of the image whilst ensuring it remains functional. 

## Contribute

We welcome anyone wishing to expand the functionality of the project. Therefore, if you wish to contribute to the project please see our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/SamPIngram/CSC-Software-Stack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Credit
This project orchestrates the utility of many different software tools and applications. This project couldn't exist without the open source contributions of many people. On the shoulders of giants we stand.
