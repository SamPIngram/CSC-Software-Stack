# TODO

- Check it will work with multiple versions of QAT+ (watch the venv naming here. Should we set and env or move to generic)
- Any way to update website display name via django script? Look for how the admin form is processed
- Add the docker-compose along with some rationale for this version
- Add the portainer template ready for deployment.
